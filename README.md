# Dijkstra's Algorithm Pathfinder

An interactive web application that visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path on a grid. Users can draw walls, set start and end points, and watch as the algorithm explores the grid to find the most efficient route.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Grid:** A configurable grid where users can draw obstacles (walls).
- **Dijkstra's Visualization:** Watch step-by-step as Dijkstra's algorithm explores the grid.
- **Shortest Path Display:** Once the algorithm is complete, the shortest path from start to end is highlighted.
- **Statistics:** Real-time updates on the number of nodes visited and the final path length.
- **Control Panel:** Easy-to-use buttons to start the algorithm, clear the path, and reset the entire grid.

## üöÄ How to Run

## üìñ What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular and efficient algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works by visiting nodes in order of increasing distance from the starting node, guaranteeing that the first time a node is visited, the path to it is the shortest possible.
